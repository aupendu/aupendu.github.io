      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Video restoration is an essential component of multimedia processing, with applications in archival preservation, media production, streaming, and consumer content. 
        This tutorial offers a structured overview of the field, tracing developments from classical filtering to deep learning and generative approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        We structure the discussion around four perspectives: enhancement of perceptual detail, restoration of chromatic fidelity, adaptation to unknown degradations, and development of unified restoration frameworks. 
        The tutorial concludes with an outlook on emerging research directions, including adaptation of foundation models, test-time refinement, generative architectures, and multimodal guidance.
